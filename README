The vision of BeerMap is to create a piece of software 
that is capable of accessing and manipulating a database
of beers.  Currently, this database is populated by
the dataset provided by Open Beer Database
(http://openbeerdb.com/). BeerMap consists of the 
server and database backend, a web front-end, and
an android application front-end.  Currently, the
android application is located here: 
https://github.com/youcaughtafish/bm4a .

This application is the second iteration of BeerMap,
with this iteration created using Maven 
(http://maven.apache.org/) and Spring MVC/web
(http://www.springsource.org/).

This application has been developed using Tomcat
7 (http://tomcat.apache.org/) and a MySQL database
(http://www.mysql.com/).

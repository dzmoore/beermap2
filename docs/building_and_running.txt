This project is built using Maven.  The project can be built and 
packaged into a war file by executing the following command
from the root of the project directory:

mvn clean package

This will create a war file within the 'target' directory.
This war file can then be deployed into a servlet container
(this app was developed using Apache Tomcat).  For tomcat,
deploying is as easy as copying the war file into 
$CATALINA_HOME/webapps.

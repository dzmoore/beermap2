The vision of BeerMap is to create a piece of software 
that is capable of accessing and manipulating a database
of beers.  Currently, this database is populated by
the dataset provided by Open Beer Database
(http://openbeerdb.com/). BeerMap consists of the 
server and database backend, a web front-end, and
an android application front-end.  Currently, the
android application is not under source control,
but it will be added to github in the future.

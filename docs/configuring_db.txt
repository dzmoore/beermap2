BeerMap2 uses a MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/) database.  Assuming 
an instance of MySQL is installed and setup on the current machine, 
loading the BeerMap dataset is fairly straight forward.  Log into the
mysql application:

mysql -u root -p

and enter the root password.

Create a new database (the code baseline uses 'beerdb'):

create database beerdb;

Exit the mysql application.  Take the sql dump from this
baseline, and import it into mysql:

mysql -u root -p beerdb < beerdb.sql

The beerdb database should now be imported.  Please note 
that this works on *nix OS's (and cygwin), but a different
process may need to occur on a windows installation without
cygwin.

Also note that the database usernames and passwords are 
currently required in some *-service.xml files (they 
should really only be in one; add a TODO).  The usernames
and passwords in these files need to be changed to reflect
the username/password configured for your local database.

The vision of BeerMap is to create a piece of software that is capable of accessing and manipulating a database of beers.  Currently, this database is populated by the dataset provided by Open Beer Database (http://openbeerdb.com/). BeerMap consists of the server and database backend, a web front-end, and an android application front-end.  Currently, the android application is located here: https://github.com/youcaughtafish/bm4a.

This application is the second iteration of BeerMap, with this iteration created using Maven (http://maven.apache.org/) and Spring MVC/web (http://www.springsource.org/). This application has been developed using Tomcat 7 (http://tomcat.apache.org/) and a MySQL database (http://www.mysql.com/).
